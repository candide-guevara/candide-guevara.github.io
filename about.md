Hi there I am Candide. As you can see from the blog entries my interests revolve around:

* Programming and CS in general
* Skiing
* Motorcycles (man I still remember that warm feeling of rolling the throttle on an old CBF 500)

### Shameless self-promotion (NOT looking for new position)

Passionate software developer with several years experience different functional domains (travel industry, finance, systems administration).
In particular highly distributed systems for online transaction processing. 
Innovation enthusiast, always looking for a new or old technology to ease development pain or implement a killer new feature.

Please note that the opinions expressed in this blog are solely my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my current or former employers.
