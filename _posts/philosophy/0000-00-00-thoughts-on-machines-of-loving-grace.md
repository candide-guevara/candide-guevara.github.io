[Dario Amodei "Machines of Loving Grace"](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) is an opportunity to explore the ambivalent nature of progress.

To be clear from the start, AI threatens my position in society.
It may negatively impact my income, render all my training useless and trivialize my contributions to society and other people.
My critique will inevitably be colored by this negativity.

"Machines of Loving Grace" is colored by the assumption of a purely individualistic and material view of the human experience,
in striking similarity to the models upon which AGI is based.
It treats society as an agglomeration of loosely coupled pieces, obviating second order effects.
Over-simplifying complexity and discussing progress without examining the values it is based upon, fatally leads the essay to contradict itself.

I believe that humans are not only the sum of the cells in their body, we are also influenced by the environment we live in.
I am skeptic that drugs and interventions focused exclusively on the individual will completely cure mental illness.
Imagine if it was the case, would that not undermine many of the advances in the essay?
Why should we promote democracy if we can live perfect happiness under an autoritarian regime by altering our perception with drugs?

The work speaks of AI as a tool for different types of freedom, yet it also mentions that subordination to the machine will be required.
How do we value biological freedom against being confined to manual labor as our only competitive advantage?
Going a bit further, if humans can only produce value with their muscles, how can we realistically reduce economic inequalities across countries?
Globalisation thrives by exploiting cheap labor in poor countries, AI will not break that fundamental pattern.

How does one derive meaning from life? Is it simply by achieving certain feats?
Or do these feats allow us to create stories about ourselves and others which ultimately define our identity and our worth?
I would be surprised if anyone would happily participate in a competition where all other participants had an unfair advantage.
For this reason I think AI will trivialize our efforts and contributions.
Specially for people who were brought up thinking honest hard work would bringing social recognition.

This is the regrettable nature of a revolution.
For many people it will happen in the middle of their lifes.
They grew up in a world with different values.
They will have to accept their obsolescence as a tribute to progress towards a future they consider dystopian.

Mr Amodei put forward a vision to inspire us to action.
Only action can shape the future, doubt cripples action.
In that sense I welcome his effort.
However the essay misses its target audience.
It should not only be focused on progress but also on reducing the suffering of those living during the transition.
