> Power numbers for kuberg look fishy

### Dealerships

* oset : [bike smith][6]
  * available in [oset e-shop][14]
* electric motion : [cp motorsport][7] (seems like a good shop), [bike smith][6]

## Important stuff

### Offroading close to home

Without knowing german, google will not give you an authoritative answer.
The only clear off-limits areas are natural parks.

* Bavaria : Who the f\*ck knows ? Forums on the internet are not clear. Apparently it varies according to the land.
* Tyrol :  Who the f\*ck knows ? Forums on the internet are not clear.
* To compare the law in France is [pretty clear][15]
  * la circulation des véhicules à moteur est interdite en dehors des voies classées dans le domaine public routier de l'Etat, des départements et des communes, des chemins ruraux et des voies privées ouvertes à la circulation publique des véhicules à moteur. Il y a donc un principe d'interdiction dans les espaces naturels et ruraux, assorti de dérogations, et, a contrario, une ouverture à la circulation des véhicules à moteur sur la voirie qui n'est pas fermée de façon explicite à la circulation publique des véhicules à moteur. Une première disposition de restriction de la circulation concerne les parcs naturels régionaux, territoires ruraux par excellence.
  * I would just need to call the mairie to know which tracks are open to motorcycles.

In any case I would have to buy a trialer to get somewhere. Not sure about which driving license I would need. This complicats matters further...

### Related motorcycle clubs (less 1h hour drive)

I do not think I would find any english speaker, but I list the establishments just in case.

* [trial club munich][9] : interesting tutorial videos
* [mcc hausham][10] : close to miesbach
* [mcs lechgau][11] : close to landsberg am lech (to the west of munich)

## Conclusion

### trial or enduro ?

Although enduro is my end goal, it presents many disadvantages for the lone beginner :

* Cannot use it on the isar valley (cops will just fine my to death)
* Too big and heavy to put it in the car to get to any track
* I do not have a clue about places to ride

Trial are a low friction way to start riding on dirt. The isar valley is just 5min away.
A small electrical trial should not bother other people on the valley.

### which trial model ?

* kuberg : something does not look right, the specs are too good. But there is no one on youtube actually using it to jump big boulders.
* electric motion : sweet, french but too epensive. Looking at the amount of posts on ebay for any trial bike, the chances of resell look slim.
  * getting it would be a hassle since you have to go to the dealership + immatriculation ? The quarantine context would make things slower...
* oset : a shame it has the lower power and battery. However it has [reviews][12] (even from googlers) and people can actually do [cool stuff][13]
  * if I like trials, I could try to [bike smith][6] and trade the oset for an electrc-motion without losing all the initial investment (not sure about that though)
