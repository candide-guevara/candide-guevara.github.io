This a small selection of the good restaurants or hand made food I have come across.
I am not wealthy enough to eat at 3 star Michelin restaurants. So I came up with my own "Guevara" stars.
But mind you ! Being awarded a Guevara star is not as easy as it looks !!

By the way, if you are some of those people that prefer healthy to tasty get the f\*\*k out of my blog !
I like salty, sweet and greasy stuff !

## Portugal

In my humble opinion the best place in Europe to eat for a reasonable price.
For the moment it is the only country with a 3-star I have found.

* TODO: what was the name of that restaurant in Coimbra ...
* Taberna Tipica Quarta Feria (Evora) \*\*\* : wow ...

## France

You may have thought that this was the best country for food. I think you are half right.
It is certainly the country where you find the most food artisans. Even the simplest product has a
long tradition behind it. But you will only find good restaurants (at a reasonable price) if you
get away from the tourist roads.

If you ever find yourself in the Cote d'Azur just eat at Mc Donalds. Same food quality than the fancy
restaurant close to the sea.

* Les Canailles menilmontant \* : proper french restaurant (why are those so rare ?!)
* TODO: i think there is a place called la poudriere somewhere close to bordeaux ...

## Spain

* Tubal (Tafalla) \*

## Poland

Even if the food is a bit rustic (even for my taste) the quality/price ratio is really nice.

* TODO: name the restaurant close to the white forest ...

## Hungary

## Ireland

* Forest and Marcy \*\* (but expensive !!)
* Clanbrassil house \* : they really know how to use that coal stove

## Germany

* Munich Burger joint trio : Hamburgerei/Holy Burger/Ruff's Burgers
* Munich ramen selection : Takumi (personally prefer 1)
* Deutsches Haus Dinkelsbuehl \*

## Greece

I always hear people say how great food in Greece is. I was really disappointed when I visited :-(
I guess some people just find that the food is healthier so they overestimate it.

* TODO: what was the name of that tavern in Leonidio ...

## Switzerland

Prices limited my ability to discover nice places.

* Lugano La fermata \* : burger + texmex paradise
* Grotto della salute \*
