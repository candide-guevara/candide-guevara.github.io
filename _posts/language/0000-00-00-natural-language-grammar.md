Learning a new language is a great way to revisit grammar concepts that were forced into my brain as a child but I never actually fully understood.
I cannot say that I grok them now, but it is starting to make sense in me.

# Verbs

## Transistive / intransistive / reflexive

* Transitive : the verb acts on something, most common case.
    * el perro muerde el juguete
* Intrasitive : the verb does not have an object
    * el perro regres√≥ a la casa
* Reflexive : the subject and object are the same
    * el perro se sienta
