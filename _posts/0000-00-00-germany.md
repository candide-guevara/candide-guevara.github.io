title: Germany, reflecting on my experience so far

Since my time in Switzerland, I noticed I go through a cycle when moving to a new country : `novelty -> culture shock -> feeling of not belonging -> appreciate the good parts and cope with the rest`.
The goal of this short writing is to try to objectively compare the good and bad points (from my point of view).
As I live in Munich this will mostly be bavarian centric.

## The good

* Free highways !
  * Relatively easy access to the Alps and ski resorts.
* Schatzkammer, a type of museum very common here, some of which contain the most beatiful pieces of jewellery I have ever seen (period).
  * The [statuette of St Georges][0] in the Munich residence.
  * The [Golden Horse][1] in Altoetting (this was done in Paris :-)
  * The ivory and lapis lazuli [coin cabinet][2] from Angermair.
  * And hopefully many more pleasant discoveries in the future
* A have the feeling that the conservation policy for monuments is different in Germany compared to France.
  * In France most of what you will see has been conserved to reflect its whole history.
  * In Germany you frequently see buildings restored to their former glory (love the sparkles :-)
  * Could also well be that many of them were actually destroyed ...
* The memory effort to show visitors the underlying mechanisms that allowed national socialism to control german society.
  * The chilling effect of seing this applied nowadays in other countries ...
* The peaceful streets of Munich, with its pastel colored buildings and shade trees.
* Sweet treats like Kaiserschmarrn, Rote Gruetze, black forest Kirschtorte ...
* This is purely subjective but fruits (at least the kind I usually eat) taste better.
  * This could explain the excellent schnaps quality (mostly in Tyrol though).


## The bad

* Sweets are nice, but man, the rest of the food is just terrible :-(
  * Can somebody explain me what is the dealio with schnitzel ? I do not dislike it, but why is it on the menu of very german restaurant under the sun ?
  * Dishonorable mention to : kaesespaetzle, kaesekrainer. 
  * Imagine my disappointment when trying Nueremberg sausages. They taste like grease and smoke. I would kill right now for a saucisse de morteau.
* Why do people like to waste their time going to different shops to buy their car shampoo and their groceries ? Can you just have hypermarkets and move on ?
* The flat land around Muenchen is boring for motorcycling.
* Has any german engineer ever conceived the idea of repairing a country road **one lane** at a time ? Instead they love to close the whole damn thing and send people on "umleitung".
  * Kid you not, this happens about every 40km when you travel on small roads.


## The (really) ugly

* Stau, stau, stau everywhere you go !
* EC cards : burn them ! Please just use the same standards as the rest of the western world use.
  * And **please stop** calling them "german cards", that just confuses and angers tourists.

### German language is beginner unfriendly

I often heard about german : "once you know the rules, the language will be clear to you". 
That turned out to be a **load of BS**.
German is the most irregular language I have come across 

* 3 genders and no way to guess to which a word belongs
* irregular conjugation
* 5 plural forms and sometimes additional umlauts to break your balls
* spiral shaped number naming, 123 is pronounced hundred-three-and-twenty
* inconsistent transformation depending on the grammatical category of a group ("in der" is actually femenine)
* ambiguous subject-verb order, making it impossible to distinguish affirmation and questions (on sundays, walk I my dog)
* phrasal verbs have their syllables shuffled around the sentence
* whydoyouhatespacesandmakeupcompositewords, doesthislookreadabletoyou (atLeastUseCamelCase) ?
* it is like if the language was designed to kick you in the nut sack

### Why do I perceive people as rude so often ?

This has puzzled me for a while. I think it mostly boils down to "people will be nicer once I speak german".
Anyhow, here is a list of reasons why this is all in my head :

* I mostly address people in English. If you are not used to another language I can understand you will adopt a direct style that can shock by its lack of politeness mannerism.
  * People (me first) get frustrated when they cannot fully express themselves.
  * However german has modal verbs, with similar usages. I would think that may encourage their use when people are speaking english.
* I am not used to the sound of german, so I percieve it as sounding aggresive.
  * I am still getting over the fact an ugly sounding word (to my romance-language-centric ear) like "schmuck" means jewel.
* Maybe being polite here actually means go straight to the point and cut the politeness cr\*p.
* The usage of exclamation marks when using the imperative form is not considered aggresive here.
* Google translate usually has a gloomy tone when tranlating german (try it on a speeding ticket !)
* This is kind of snow balling, given past experience, now I am much more defensive when interacting with strangers.

And here are some actual facts to nuance the previous list :

* In many fancy restaurants, waiters will not greet you when you leave.
* I had the absolutely worst experience interacting with custom officers when moving my stuff.
  * somehow I should get over that horrible first impression.
  * but, honestly, f\*ck you german customs ! It is not like me or all of the unlucky eastern european truck drivers that cross the border are going to learn german any time soon...
* nothing else I can think of now that occurs with any relevant frequency, so I guess that proves the point I am imagining things.
