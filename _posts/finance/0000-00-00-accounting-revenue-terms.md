I am tired of getting bullied by accounting jargon during earning reviews...

### The [depreciation][0] trick

Capital expenditure on assets does NOT figure in the income statement.
Instead the money spent will be deducted over the lifetime of the asset as a depreciation expense.
> This artificially boosts income since only part of the capex on assets is deducted from profits

`depreciation = (asset_value - liquidation_price) / useful_life`

### [Cash/Accrual][1] accounting

The accrual method accounts revenue as soon as the goods/services have been invoiced (but payment may not have been received).
> This can explain discrepancies with the [cash flow statement][2] of the company
