### General perf tips
* Full table scan may be faster than using index access if query returns > 10% of table rows.
  Full scans take advantage from multi-block IO
* To fully exploit machine CPU there should be a ratio of 10 process per processor. Only a few
  will be active at any time due to IO waits. Process should belong to different sessions to avoid waiting is synchronized
* A good indication of execution plan performance : consistent get count * block size, if it is several time bigger
  than the table size then it may not be optimal
* Know the application using the DB => OLTP should be optimized for querying and updating a small number of rows
  (selective and few indexes). Data mining should be optimized for complex queries returning lots of data and batch updates (bitmap indexes ...)

### Optimizer
* RBO - rule based optimizer (deprecated)
* CBO - cost based optimizer for sql queries, evaluates the cost of a request by estimating the number of consistent gets,
  IO and cpu it will consume. It relies **heavily on statistics** which allow oracle to infer the hidden structure of the data
  and adapt as it evolves over time. (a bit like machine learning ??)
* Statistics consist of : the underlying machine characteristics (avg IO read/write, avg consistent read ...),
  and data distribution (distinct values in columns, frequency of each value, table size ...)
* Bind variables may generate sub optimal execution plans. Ex: if an index contains key with high and low selectivity
  (data distribution is not even) then it may be worth only for some queries.
* Queries using joins on N tables may produce N! different execution plans. The optimizer will only try a subset.
* Parallelization can change the execution plan (// prefers full tables scans over index, nested loops for joins over hash joins ...)
* Histograms are more sensitive to sampling. If the sampled population is not representative, it may not reflect the truth distribution

### Performing Indexes
* Selectivity of an index determines table scan or not. However the exact selectivity of a key can
  only be known with an histogram with as many buckets as keys. In other scenarios oracle will estimate it
* NULL values are not indexed in oracle b-tree indexes. If a request uses an indexed key only for an "order by" clause
  then the index will not be taken. Solve it by declaring the column not NULL
* B-tree indexes are more effective when predicates on several indexes are combined using AND
* Insertion in a b-tree index takes around **3 times more** time than insertion in the table
* Bitmap indexes work better with keys of low selectivity (~1%) and high cardinality
  => to be better than a full scan they have to be combined (logical operations on the bitmaps).
  **Updates on bitmap indexed tables can lock several blocks** at once.
* When performing heavy updates it may be better to drop index and rebuild it at the end using //

Index on foreign keys speed up the update in parent tables ??
Updating indexed columns can side effect and lock other unrelated rows in table ?
