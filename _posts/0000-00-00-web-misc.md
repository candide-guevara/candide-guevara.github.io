## Virtual hosting

The same machine corresponds the multiple domain names. This allows to host several websites in 1 host,

* name vhost : the machine has only one address, the site to server is selected based on the domain name on the url
  * You cannot access the site by IP unless you specify the target domain on http headers.
  > example `curl -H 'Host:vhost_coucou'` http://123.132.123.123/`
  * If machine serves different subdomains (ex: kong.com and diddy.com) it cannot serve https since it needs to present the right certificate on the SSL handshake, before any data is transfered to the server.
    * This can be overcome with [SNI][0], but it makes sensorship possible by leaking the domain name to listeners.
* ip vhost : the machine has at least 1 IP address per domain name, the site is selected based on the IP header only

## Web Server components

* Reverse proxy - opposite to a proxy client which performs requests on behalf of clients in the same network
  a reverse proxy answers to queries on behalf of the server, load balances ...
* WSGI - web service gateway interface : python standard to connect a HTTP server to an app server,
  mod_wgsi is an apache module that implements it
* FastCGI - in CGI (common gateway interface) each HTTP request will trigger the creation of a **new system process to execute the scripts creating the response**.
  In fast CGI a daemon will answer to the HTTP server to avoid process overhead => starting concept for an application server
* Nginx - widely used Http server that can also be configured as a reverse proxy for static content, SSL Offloader (wikipedia) ...
