I guess is normal that when you get older you have a hard time to cope with massive volumes of information.
For several years now I have tried to work on small projects not related to my work. It normally takes me
a few months to finish, then I switch to a new topic. While migrating some of those projects to Github I
realized that I had _forgotten_ all details about them (for some I could not remember them at all). Such 
a waste of effort, all those late hours hacking for nothing but the fun of it !

If I forget must of the stuff I have done then what I am ? Just the handful of thoughts that I can keep in
my head for a few days ? Sounds awfully similar to the definition of a zombie ...

At the end, after many years of experience I have gained only the ability to recognize many patterns. I
feel like I re-discover the main concepts of a new system more rapidly now. The problem is that sometimes
those same patterns trick me into not considering a particular relation between components. I am often
amazed at how new comers bring in new ideas that force me to reconsider the way I modeled the problem in
my head.

One question that I struggle to answer is how much this affects other people. I know colleagues that can
recall details of any previous meeting during the last six months. And they do so _within seconds_. They
are also able to traverse the graph of relationships between components in a not so trivial system. It
seems like they do so without effort, it seems like the answer was calculated by a background process.

For example, honor our latency constraints at work we have several layers of caching. The cached itself
is distributed in several nodes. To add complexity there are several types of cache clients that are 
read or write. I remember (for once) my boss telling me different scenarios where we could end up with
inconsistent data just after I explained him the system.

Voila, even if this post is not really encouraging I hope I will keep my courage to learn and build as
many things as I can. Even if I forget everything the day after. Maybe this is what the myth of
Sisyphus is really all about ... Or maybe this is just life for everyone, you must keep fighting against
human nature and all its defects. Gosh, God is the worst engineer ever to come up with such a flawed
design !!
