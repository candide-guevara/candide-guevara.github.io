title: Climbing your way up in a big company
categories : [fun, rant, office]

Working for a big company has its fair share ludicrousness. Sometimes I really wonder if the
HR people working on the hierarchical organisation are hardcore role play gamers.

First, as in any decent RPG you have levels. Your level will determine your stats. The most
important one (of course) is your salary ! But to spice things up a little, once you reach
certain levels you gain special abilities. Like summoning a shining corporate car.

Then you can choose your character class. In Diablo II you have amongst others : Paladin, 
Barbarian and my favourite Necromancer. Here you can choose between :

* the manager : commander of hordes of lesser programmers
* the project coordinator : time wizard that can predict the future
* the expert : minion that has survived enough wars to earn a veteran status

The problem here is that the tier list is not well balanced. Even if every class is essential
to the company, the expert always gets the smallest part of the pie. He has to prove its worth
for many years before being accepted by the guild. Once a member, he will never achieve the
fame and fortune of the mighty commander.

**Note:** do not take my rants too seriously, I still think it is a fine company and a nice place to work :-)
