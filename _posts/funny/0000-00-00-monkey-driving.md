Some years ago I passed the French motorbike license.
Before actually getting on the bike you have to go through a multiple choice question test.
I remember some questions were just wicked :/

So I wondered what the driving license test for monkeys could be like...

## Question 1

![question 1]({{ site.images }}/code1.jpg){: .my-block-small-img }

### Answer Question 1

![solution 1]({{ site.images }}/code1Correction.jpg){: .my-block-small-img }

## Question 2

![question 2]({{ site.images }}/code2.jpg){: .my-block-small-img }

### Answer Question 2

![solution 2]({{ site.images }}/code2Correction.jpg){: .my-block-small-img }
