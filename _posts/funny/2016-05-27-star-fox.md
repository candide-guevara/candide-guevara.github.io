I hate when your device OS is built to resist you. 
Since I pay for my phone, sometimes I feel like I am being scammed.
I wish [General Pepper][1] will once again pronounce those [immortal words][2] :

We need your help help Star Fox.  
**Android** has declared war.  
He has invaded the **Linux** system and is trying to take over **Kernelia** !  
Our army alone can't do the job.  
Hurry Star Fox !
