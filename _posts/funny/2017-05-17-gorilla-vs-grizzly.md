title: Can a Gorilla beat a Grizzly ?
categories : [fun]
---

Ever since discovering Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, I have been fascinated by primates.
But even if DK is able to claim its stollen bananas from King K. Rool, will he emerge victorious from a 1-to-1 fight against a grizzly bear ?
A quick look at wikipedia seems to rule this out. At around 200kg and 1.7m the gorilla is roughly half the size of the grizzly (500kg and 3m).

But this answer does not satisfy me. It is not all about raw power, brains should also be counted into the equation.

Surely, out on an open field a bear's faster top speed and sharp claws may mean game over for our banana-loving hero.
But in the middle of the forest, Gorillas should have the upper hand knowing that heavy grizzlys are poor climbers. 
And if arcade fighting games have taught me anything is that characters with a dive kick are often god-tier.

I am convinced that a well trained Gorilla can gain the skill to execute a perfect dive kick, powerful enough to briefly stun his salmon-loving foe,
allowing him to quickly apply a strong waist lock from behind and perform the strongest wrestling move on the book : the german suplex.

So stand proud brave Gorilla for you have achieved victory !
