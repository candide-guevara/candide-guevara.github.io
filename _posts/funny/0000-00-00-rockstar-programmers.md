Here in France I have the feeling a lot of people think software engineers are dull and boring.
If you too have troubles motivating your friends into programming try some of these examples.

* [Grace Hopper][1] : Major Cobol contributor and US Navy Admiral. I bet she would be a badass One Piece character !
* [David Heinemeier Hansson][2] : Major Ruby on Rails contributor and race car driver.
* [Dennis Ritchie][4] : One of the inventors of the C language and also a skilled driver, although for heavier vehicles.
* [Kenneth Thompson][6] : Master mind behind Unix, eminent C++ opponent, and alligator tamer.
* [Jamie Zawinski][3] : Major Mozilla contributor and nightclub owner.
* [Scott Meyers][5] : Is it just me or this renowned C++ expert is also known as Luke Skywalker ?

I will try to keep this updated as I hear about other amazing developer lifes.
