title: Switzerland, worst place for skiers
categories : [article, fun, rant]

After movnig to Switzerland I was looking forward to the skiing season. 
After visiting many different resorts in the cantons of Valais and Grisons, my experience has not been positive.
Of course, your experience depends on the type of skier you are. If you share the points below then read on.

* Arrive early, leave only after the slopes are closed, never stop for lunch (grab a bite when you are going up)
* Weather conditions or slope difficulty are not a problem (even if I fall quite often :p )
* Decent skier, mono-skier and a snowboard rookie

## The Snow

Let's start with the most important criteria, **the snow**.
Apart from [Saas-Fee][1] with many slopes in the shade, snow melts away pretty fast on hot weeks. Nothing new compared to the rest of Europe.
The problem in Switzerland is the artifical snow facilities. Even big resorts like [Arosa Lenzerheide][2] have not invested enough.
The majority uses mobile snow canons that are parked away most of the time. So the slopes that see a lot of trafic at the bottom
of the station get rocky pretty quickly.

The rides lack diversity, in many places there is no ungroomed or mogul slopes, no jump or trick parks. 
I cannot comment on off-piste because I do not know the resorts well-enough to know the good trails.

### Weather

Nothing special to say here, except this little anecdote.
When I visited [Saas-Fee][1], they closed 100% of the station for a whole day. The reason ? There was **too much powder** (it had being snowing all day).
Silly me, I always thought the problem was to have few snow ...
Even in smaller villages like [Isola 2000][12], they will open at least a part of the trails while they are working on the rest, making sure it is safe.
By the way, did I mention that Saas-Fee has a **no-reimburse policy** because of the weather ?

### Total slope distance and vertical drop

Compared to France's behemoths like [Paradiski][6] or [Alpe d'Huez][7], resorts are relatively small. 
For example [Laax-Flims][10] one of the largest in Grisons is the same size as [Vars-Risoul][11] (which by the way is excellent, cheap an seldom known).

On the other side, vertical drop is pretty good. It often goes over 3000 meters, the base being around 1200 meters. 
The highest place I have ever skied is in [Zermatt][5] at 3900 meters.

### Landscapes

This time Switzerland comes on top. 
Compared to some of France's resorts like [La Plagne][3] or [Les Sybelles][4] there are less of those ugly concrete buildings.
For example [Valbella][2] with its many hotels, manages to keep a certain charm, in my opinion.
Moerover, in villages like [Zermatt][5], with its no car policy, you can even ski in the streets among the wooden chalets.
Not to mention the slopes surrounding the Matternhorn, a sight to behold.

Beautiful but not very convinient as discussed below.

## Ski resorts

I rarely felt welcome when visiting a Swiss ski station.
Even from the very start, you struggle to find the trail map on their web site.

### Design/Convinience

The time you spend going down the slopes is but a fraction of the time you need to go up. This is why "debrayable" chairlifts were invented.
But in [Andermatt][9] someone had the great idea of connecting the 2 halves of the station by train. 
Furthermore, it only passes every hour and the train stop is several minutes by foot from the slopes (face palm).

Other places like [Valbella][2] adopt a more sensible approach by providing free buses. However, they stop the service just after 17h. 
If you felt like doing that extra detour through the woods and land at the opposite side from where you parked your car, then you pay extra !

Is it your first time enjoying the bliss of gliding on the snow ? 
Bad luck there are no green level slopes in Switzerland. Maybe natives are born with natural skill but I had a few rough days when I started snowboarding. 
Even for expert surfers, it is very frequent to come across trails going **up** (even swiss gravity is against you!). So be prepared to get out of your bindings.

### Prices and facilities

Wow ! A rough calculation of price over slope distance comes out to be more than double compared to France.
Not only that, they want to squeeze the last cent out of your pocket. Parking is not included, so add another 5 to 20 francs.

Dishonorable mention to [Saas-Fee][1], it charges a 50% higher fee if you park all day compared to the 7 hours price. Not to mention that there is a 15 minute walk to the first skilift.

But the real **cr@p award** goes to [Zermatt][5]. You cannot access the village by car, you must leave it in a village 5km away and pay for parking+ride !
Better go to [Cervinia-Breuil][8] just on the other side of the frontier. Then drop your vehicle 100 meters away from the skilift that crosses the border back to Zermatt.

### Renting your gear

So you had to mortgage your house just to pay for the entry ticket, now you enter the nearest renting shop to get your gear.
By now it should be no surprise that you pay a **lot**. What you do not know is that they close at 17h, not a minute later (I checked this in [Laax-Flims][10] and [Valbella][2]). 
So you cannot stay until the slopes close or you may not make it before they call it a day (specially in big stations).

## Conclusion

The snow may be white here, but people's heart is black as dark chocolate.
More seriously, you **can** enjoy Switzerland's skiing if you just go down 2 or 3 slopes and spend the rest of your day admiring the view and sipping mulled wine.
But if you truly experience bliss when sliding and only go home when your knees are begging for it, then consider going some place else.

It still have many places to visit in several countries before I can deliver a comprehensive judgement. But for now, the best country to go is for sure France.
