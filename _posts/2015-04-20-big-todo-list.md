title: Big impossible todo list
categories : [article, radar]
---

This is a big todo list with all the cool stuff I want to learn. This is a separate file from
my technology radar because it is meant to have less priority. And let's face it you will not
live long enough to touch even half of the items.

## Mathematics

### Complexity Theory

* Defintion terminology : certificate, problem ...
* Definition + ex : P, NP, NP hard, NP complete problems
* Example of mapping NP-complete to other problems
* Problem set potato diagram
* Cook-levin theorem (implication of P=NP)
* Uncomputability (HALTING problem and Godel imcompletness)
* Description turing machine

### Quamtum Computing

* Definition : adiabatic
* Definition : quantum annealing
* Definition : qubit
* Definiton : schrodinger's eq
* Definition + main properties : wave func solution to schro eq
* Definition : entanglement
* Comparison : gate model (matrix calculus and properties) VS quantum annealing
* Facts about DWAVE (is it soo good as it sounds ?)
* Interpretation of interference experiement (duality wave/particule)
* Explain the following algorithms : Deutschâ€“Jozsa / Grover / Shor factorization

### Information Theory

* Shanon information content
* Non null rate of transmission over unreliable channel is possible
* Entropy definition, mutual info definition
* Compression = entropy * data (demo)
* Baye inference for distribution parameters and models
* Huffman algo
* Arithmetic coding

### Stochastic Monte Carlo methods

* What is the goal, what can we calculate ?
* Analogy with energy, momentum and entropy of a physical system
* Metropolis method idea
* Rejection/importance sampling

### Machine Learning

* Minimum search heuristics : Simulated annealing, Genetic
* Clustering : K means (hard and soft version)


## Software

### Hotspot JVM architecture
* Diagram : interpreter + server/client compilers + runtime (class loader, GC) + heap
* Diagram : representation of classes/methods/objects in the heap
* Explanation : compiling / decompiling bytecode at method level (inlining + virtual ??)
* Explanation : stack frames interpreted/compiled
* Example of bytecode file/intructions

## JEE high-level architecture
* Diagram : HTTP server + servlets + beans + persistence components + ws endpoints ...
* Diagram : HTTP server + spring ...
* Diagram : JPA persistence components + hibernate implementation
* Diagram : configuration files (web.xml, persistence.xml, ejb.xml, beans.xml, standalone.xml ...)
