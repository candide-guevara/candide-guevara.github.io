I do not know why but I always have a hard time remembering the right commands to draw curves. 
Be it matplotlib or gnuplot I always have to go back to the documentation. Hopefully this will help me remember.
There is a nice introduction [here](https://lwn.net/Articles/631475/).

* When using IPython use magic command **%matplotlib inline** followd by **import matplotlib as mpl**
* Can use latex macros by enclosing then in $ signs
