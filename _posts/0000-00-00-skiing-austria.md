I had a nice run this season on Austrian slopes. Now it is the dreaded time of schools holidays, so I guess I will stay home for while.

> Hors-piste : only takes into account places you can get easily (without walking if possible)

## Remarks

* Arlberg (Lech and Warth, could not visit St Anton)
  * Flat, flat, flat ! Lifts are long and horizontal ...
  * Boring endless flat runs with snowboard
  * Laugh at [Strolz store][11] (maybe they meant __stronzo__ ?). Some people are convinced that paying a lot for gear will make you better :-)

* Ischgl  
  * Silly skibuses with inconvenient stops a few 100m away from the slopes  
  * Hard slopes are impossible for snowboard : lots of U shaped runs :-(
  * Beware of swiss schedules in Samnaun side (at 16h is over) 
  * Moguls everywhere :-) Maybe because of less grooming given it is a carbon neutral resort ?

* Obergurgl
  * Slow horizontal lift connecting the 2 side of the resort

* SerfausFiss
  * Easy access to __lots__ of powder slopes
  * Better park in Fiss (waldbahn) ! Stupid ubahn system if you park in Serfaus
  * Both nice long wide blue and vertical black runs (on the shade)

* Soelden
  * Free covered parking next to the lift (giggijochbahn) !

## Cheap and convinient places to stay

* Pfunds : easy access to both Ischgl and SerfaussFiss
* Soelden : easy access to both Soelden and Obergurgl
* Steeg : cheap but risky !
  * Road from Warth to Lech is closed. __CHECK connecting lifts are open !__
