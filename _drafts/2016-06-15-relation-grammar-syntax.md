When I was a kid I did not understand what grown-ups meant by "grammar".
When I started programming I did not grasp the difference between a syntax and grammar errors.
Unfortunately I do not have a definite answer, but after looking at lambda theory, I have a better idea.

## Syntax 

## Grammar

## Can we actually **define** a grammar for natural languages ?

A program is well defined if a compiler can translate it to machine code. So we can propose that a program is grammatically correct if it compiles. It can be argued that no 2 compilers are the same because they understand a programming language specification in subtly different ways. But I believe this gives a pretty solid test for grammatically correct. Which in turns provides a concrete and complete set of grammar rules : the compiler **itself** is the grammar.

For natural languages we could say that a sentence is well defined if it can be understood. But each one has its interpretation of the language, and there are far more people than implementations of a compiler for a particular language. Our cultural background is different, we have different vocabulary, the same word can have different interpretations, etc... So there is no real **universal** set of rules defining which sentences can be understood unambiguously by any speaker.

In school, before teaching what a preposition or coordination conjunction are, I would suggest to start with a humble defintion of grammar. 

* A set of disparate rules to help us build understandable and relatively unambiguous sentences. 
* If we respect them we can hope to be understood by a majority of speakers.
