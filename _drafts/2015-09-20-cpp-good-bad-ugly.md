Some days you love C++, others you hate it ! Why is so ? I think is because it exposes all of its implementation complexity
to the programmer.

## The Good
**TODO** : virtual constructor, auto, duck typing, simple templating, compile time assertions

## The Bad
**TODO** : put my code snippets illustrating how C++ will f\*\*k your brain 

## The Ugly
**TODO** : CRTP, template metaprogramming, constexpr, type erasure, perfect forwarding using uref and templ meta
